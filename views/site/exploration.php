        <p class="g-mb-25">AKGC specializes in managing exploration project, offering a complete end-to-end exploration service specifically tailored to the clientâ€™s needs and situation. Our geological solutions range from grass-roots exploration to advanced resource definition. This includes data compilations & reviews, target generation, programmed design and planning, budgeting, drill supervision, project management and implementation.</p>   
         
        <h5 class="h5 g-mb-20">Mineral Tenement Assessment</h5>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Geological analysis based previous works</li>
          <li>Slope and GIS analysis</li>
          <li>Outlining based on lithology and target area</li>
          <li>Review Forestry and Tenement status</li>
        </ul>  

        <h5 class="h5 g-mb-20">Geological Mapping</h5>
        <p>We see good geology as one of the most critical ingredients in the success of any exploration and mining project.</p> 
        <p>Effective mineral exploration requires an in-depth understanding of the lithological and structural controls of mineralisation. These insights must be gained through geological mapping at the early stages of the exploration program.</p>
        <p>A good geological map not only provides focus to an exploration program, it also clearly communicates the economic potential of a project to stakeholders.</p>
        
        <h5 class="h5 g-mb-20">Drilling & Supervision Services</h5>
        <p>With expertise and experience in mineral exploration Nickel laterite, iron ores, gold, coal and other commodities, AKGC has capability in operating the drilling machines. AKGC operating rigs of Jacro 175 & Jacro 200 series and also supported by the existence of Dozer for drill pad preparation and rig mobilization. We have professional mechanics to check rig engine regularly to ensure the timeframe during drilling production.</p>
        <p>AKGC provides the small and easy moving rigs with the Max-Drill Type to support fast track production and low cost. AKGC guarantees quality of samples and maintains core recovery properly in the mineralization zone, and deliver the competitive rates with the good quality of work. We offer various drilling purpose:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Regional or Scout Drilling</li>
          <li>Drilling spacing: 400x400, 200x200, 100x100, 50x50, 25x25 meter</li>
          <li>Twin Hole Drilling for Confirmation Drilling Data</li>
          <li>Geostatistic Drilling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to drilling contractor services, AKGC provide service of drilling supervision as follow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Managing drilling strategic</li>
          <li>Set up comprehensive drilling plan</li>
          <li>Daily drilling activity supervision</li>
          <li>Set up sample preparation and assaying at drilling site</li>
          <li>Manage drilling data base</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="h5 g-mb-20"> Data Validation and Geo Evaluation</h5>
        <p>Our capabilities not only verify and build a valid database from raw data (assay, collar, survey, geology & mineralogy, density, moisture content, geotechnical, core recovery, etc.) and making it suitable and appropriate for resource estimation, and also we can also provide geological evaluation and ore type classifications.</p>
        <p>Our services including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drilling Data Validation</li>
          <li>Technical Report of Exploration, Drilling and  Data Validation</li>
        </ul>  

        <h5 class="h5 g-mb-20">Resource and Reserve Estimations</h5>
        <p>AKGC has prominent resources modelling and estimation expertise in nickel laterite deposit, however we has capability also for coal and other mineral commodities such as gold, Iron ores, manganese, limestone, tin etc.</p>
        <p>Our strength are gotten from the combination of solid exploration and mining based practical experiences, and strong technical qualifications in geostatistic, resource estimation and mining reserve estimation. Our services including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An assessment of the quantity and quality of  the data available including database management and verification</li>
          <li>The creation of 2D and/or 3D geological and mineralisation models for the deposit</li>
          <li>Statistical and geostatistical analyses of the data and the determination of the most appropriate grade and density interpolation methods</li>
          <li>Classification and reporting according to accepted and internationally recognised guidelines</li>
        </ul>
